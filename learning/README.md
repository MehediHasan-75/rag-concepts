# Learning RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This folder contains a short, practical learning path to understand and build RAG systems using the chunking examples in this repo.

Suggested learning flow:

1. 01 - Getting Started: install deps and generate the sample document.
2. 02 - Chunking: run the fixed-size, semantic, and adaptive chunkers to compare outputs.
3. 03 - Embedding & Store: learn how to create embeddings and store them (notes + next steps).
4. 04 - Retrieval & Augmentation: use filters and metadata to retrieve relevant chunks.
5. 05 - Generation: build a prompt that combines retrieved chunks + LLM for answers.

Each step has a short guide Markdown under this folder.

Resources:
- `requirements.txt` includes packages needed for local exploration.
- Example commands are provided in `scripts/run_examples.sh`.

If you'd like, I can add runnable notebooks or concrete embedding and retrieval examples next.
